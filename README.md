A website templates for building a personal resume and portfolio page.

Based on the style and page designs I created for my own portfolio site: www.maxgosselin.com

----

To use this template a basic knowledge of Python and Django are required. The styles and pages are pre-made just needing you to fill in your information and make any stylistic changes you would like.

To prepare your site for live production you can consult this guide which show's how to host a Django app on Heroku. https://www.codementor.io/jamesezechukwu/how-to-deploy-django-app-on-heroku-dtsee04d4
